          Imagine for an instance that you upload a video on YouTube and become an overnight star or
you make a tweet and that garners revenue generating attention. Fine-tuning these scenarios within
the frame of moral saliency, they can be described as instances of divine providence or grace.
According to a Guite and Soreng in their journal published in Research Gate, “Grace, in the
Christian understanding, is the unconditional love, the free and undeserved favour of God” (1). This
essay is a deep dive into the philosophy of this divine providence, whether it is identifiable
intellectually and if it can only be determined upon hindsight.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a heuristic, I believe, to which most people account for divine providence within their
lives. I categorise this heuristic in the syllogism below;
             <ul>
                 <li>Premise 1 : Nothing that brings good pleasure is wrong</li>
                 <li>Premise 2: Only God can enforce/permit good pleasure.</li>
                 <li>Conclusion: All good pleasures are from God only.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>
                In this tripartite, I am defining good pleasure to be any act that minimises suffering thereby
positively influencing well-being while being either being morally good or morally neutral. This
syllogism may appear outlandish on the surface, perhaps, due to its formal presentation, but I assert
that it is a mental model that most Christians (or any other religious folks for that matter) make in
assessing consequential issues. The illustrations in the introductory paragraph allude to that. The
claim above relies on the fact that all good things are from God alone and so it follows that all good
things that occur in one’s life are as a result of divine providence. We can call this divine providence
based on the axiom that God owes no one (otherwise, it wouldn’t be unmerited favour i.e. grace).
Now we could be pedantic and inquire as to whether “small pleasures” are products of grace. For
example, “small pleasures” like making a 3-pointer at a high school basketball game or wining a
game of frisbee with your friends on a warm Saturday afternoon. Instances like these generally can
only be labelled as graceful acts insofar as they influence well-being significantly. So we will
largely think of wining a frisbee match as an act of grace if for instance, it results in one joining the
national frisbee olympics team, thereby improving the quality of one’s life. The overarching
conjecture (the syllogism) is a popular line of reasoning whose conclusion holds true so long as it
entails the premises.
             </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            The first criticism to this line of thinking, I believe, is best seen through the multiverse
analogy below. Suppose a group of boys robbed a bank and the following ensued;
          <ul>
                 <li>In the first world, the boys were caught and in the course of time they changed and became
respectable people (who led a righteous life).</li>
                 <li>In the second world, the boys were caught but still turned out to be truants, living an unrighteous
life.</li>
                 <li>In the third world, the boys escaped and in the course of time, upon reflection of their life,
changed to became people who led righteous lives.</li>
<li>In the fourth world the boys escaped and turned out to be truants all the same.</li>
             </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the thought experiments, it may seem inconsistent with the syllogism in paragraph one to
claim that any of the situations was an act of grace simply because it ended in a net positive good. If
scenario 2 came into fruition (i.e. where the boys were caught and still turned out to be truants), it
may presuppose that God destined the boys to a life unworthy to be lived since it resorts in
condemnation. On the other hand, the tripartite will prevent one from labelling scenario 3 as an act
of divine providence. This is because the action of robbing a bank itself is not moral. It is not a good
pleasure and so from that line of reasoning, it cannot be from God, even if it results in a net good.
You can argue as per the illustration 3, that the mere retrospective realisation of one’s wrong leading
to righteousness is an act of grace. However, that commits you to the view that there can be divine
conversion of minds, in which case you would have to square that view up with the notion of free
will that most religious folks preach.
        </p>
        <p>A potential source of contention can be found in the 2nd premise. This may be brought out by
people who promulgate the view that good goods can be planted by the devil to cause or expedite
net suffering (not necessarily physical suffering). In that world view, getting a job that improves the
quality of your life (a good pleasure), can be on its own, a ploy by an evil agent. This may be a
grand ploy to sway an individual from the shadow of the divine supervisor. Since premise 2 states
that only God can enforce or permit good pleasures, the example, if valid, annuls the whole
argument because it would mean that good can be permitted or enforced by something other than
God. This inadvertently becomes a sledge hammer to the proposition is because the conclusion can
obviously not be true if it does not entail the premise. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, a critique can also be that deeds themselves are neither evil nor good and that the
potency for an action or a thing to be good or evil rests on the manner in which a conscious moral
agent wields them. Therefore, a thing or an opportunity can be graciously given, however, if the
means by which it is implemented is evil then it can in no way be attributed to a divine hand. This
results in grace becoming a concept that can only be retrospectively defined. To elaborate, it means
that no good or service can defined as an act of grace until it is utilised. This case in general is
permissible if and only if the assertion that only God can grant good pleasures is granted (which has
a lot of evidence to show). </p>
<p>In a nutshell, this essay represents an original inquiry into the nuance of divine providence,
investigating possible arguments that could be made whilst leaving the topic open to further
discussion. I hope to have done at least one of two things in this essay. To demonstrate that (1) The
concept of grace is not nearly as intellectually straightforward as we once thought and (2) There are
intricacies in the conclusions that could be drawn by assigning a deed to be an act of grace.</p>
