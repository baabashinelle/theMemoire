A repository of a simple and fully functional blogsite - The Memoire, in PHP, HTML and CSS.
The index page of this site has a summary of all the author's articles and a link to read more about each of them.
I implemented the email subscription functioanlity with PHP.
Kindly visit the site to read some interesting articles and do not forget to subscribe to my friend's blog!
